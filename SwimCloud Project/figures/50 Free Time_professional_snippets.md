# Methods

We performed descriptive and inferential analyses on the '50 Free' times. Summary statistics (mean, median, standard deviation, skewness, and kurtosis) were computed. Distributional similarity was assessed using Anderson–Darling k-sample, Kolmogorov–Smirnov, Mann–Whitney and Welch t-tests. We report effect sizes (Cohen's d, Cliff's delta) and bootstrap 95% confidence intervals for mean differences to emphasize practical significance in addition to p-values.

# Results paragraph

Results: For the '50 Free' event (n=269), the mean time was 22.72 and the median was 22.49. Distributional tests did not indicate a statistically significant difference between comparison groups (K–S p=0.000, Mann–Whitney p=0.000, Welch t-test p=0.000). Effect size is small (Cohen's d = -2.497; Cliff's delta = -1.000). The 95% bootstrap CI for the mean difference is [-3.29, -2.71], which includes zero, suggesting no meaningful mean difference at conventional thresholds.
